# 🐍 Lesson 2: Python Basics for Data Science

Welcome to **Python Basics**!  
Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science because it’s easy to learn, widely used, and has powerful libraries for analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

This lesson introduces the **core building blocks of Python** that every data scientist must know.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
- Understand what variables and data types are.
- Explain how operators, conditions, and loops work.
- Describe how functions help us reuse code.
- Be comfortable enough to move toward data-focused libraries.

## 1. Why Python for Data Science?
Python is the **glue** that connects data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
Some key reasons:
- **Beginner-friendly** → The syntax reads almost like English.
- **Rich ecosystem** → Libraries like pandas (data handling), NumPy (math), matplotlib (visualization).
- **Flexible** → Works for small experiments and large-scale production.

## 2. Variables and Data Types
A **variable** is like a box with a label on it where we store information.  
For example:  
- Numbers for age or temperature.  
- Text for names.  
- Lists for collections of items.  

**Common Data Types in Python**:
- `int` → whole numbers (e.g., 10, -3).  
- `float` → decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, 2.7).  
- `str` → text, written in quotes (e.g., "Data Science").  
- `list` → ordered collection of items (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).  

These types are the raw materials we’ll use later to build more complex analysis.

## 3. Operators
Operators let us **do something with variables**:
- **Arithmetic** → add, subtract, multiply, divide.  
- **Comparison** → check if numbers or values are greater, smaller, or equal.  
- **Logical** → combine conditions using `and`, `or`, `not`.  

They are the **tools** for making calculations and decisions.

---

## 4. Control Flow (Decision-Making)
Data analysis often requires asking **“what if…?”**.  
Control flow helps us run code differently depending on the situation.

- **If/Else** → lets us choose one path or another.  
- **Loops** → repeat the same task many times (useful for going through datasets row by row).  

This is like setting rules in an investigation: *“If the clue matches, follow this lead; otherwise, check another.”*

---

## 5. Functions
Functions are **mini-programs** inside your program.  
They take inputs, perform an action, and return an output.  

Why they matter:
- Prevent repeating the same code many times.  
- Make code **organized and readable**.  
- Many powerful Python libraries are just **collections of functions** written for you.  

Think of a function as a **machine**: you feed it something, it processes it, and gives you a result.

## 6. Practice Ideas (for the Notebook)
In your notebook, you will try things like:
1. Store your name and age in variables and print them.  
2. Create a list of your top 3 hobbies and loop through them.  
3. Write a function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
4. Use an if/else to decide if someone is allowed to drive (age ≥ 18).

## ✅ Next Steps
After you’re comfortable with these basics:
- Try simple coding exercises daily (practice builds fluency).  
- Move on to the **Tools for Data Science** lesson, where we introduce Jupyter, pandas, and matplotlib.
