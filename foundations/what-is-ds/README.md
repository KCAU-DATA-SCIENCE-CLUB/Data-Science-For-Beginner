# 📘 Lesson 1: What is Data Science?

Welcome to the very first session of **Data Science Storytelling** 🎉.  
In this lesson, we’ll uncover what Data Science *really* is—through stories, examples, and a mini project.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand what Data Science means in simple, relatable terms.
- See how it impacts everyday life.
- Learn the **workflow of a data scientist** through a storytelling analogy.
- Try a fun mini-project exploring real data.

## 🪄 Storytelling Hook

*Imagine you’re in a city where every decision—traffic lights, shopping recommendations, medical diagnoses—is powered by hidden patterns in data.*  
Behind all of this is **Data Science**—the field that helps us **turn raw numbers into meaningful insights**.

Think of a **detective** solving a mystery:
- Clues = Data  
- Detective = Data Scientist  
- Story = Insight

## 📖 What is Data Science?

**Data Science = using data to ask questions, find answers, and tell stories that help decisions.**

It stands on **3 main pillars**:

1. **Data Analysis** → exploring and understanding the data.  
2. **Machine Learning** → making predictions and automating insights.  
3. **Communication** → storytelling with visuals, reports, and narratives.

## 🌍 Why it Matters

Data Science is all around us:

- 🎬 Netflix recommends shows you’ll love.  
- 🎵 Spotify builds your daily mix.  
- ❤️ Doctors predict diseases before symptoms worsen.  
- 💳 Banks detect fraud within seconds.  

Every time you see something personalized or efficient, **data science is quietly at work**.

## 🔄 The Data Science Workflow (Detective Analogy)

Think of the process like solving a case:

1. **Collect clues** → Gather data from the world.  
2. **Organize evidence** → Clean and structure the data.  
3. **Spot patterns** → Analyze and visualize.  
4. **Make predictions** → Use models to forecast outcomes.  
5. **Tell the story** → Communicate insights clearly.  

📌 *We’ll include a diagram of this detective workflow in `assets/`.*

## 🎮 Mini Project: Your First Data Investigation

Let’s get hands-on!  
We’ll use a simple dataset (like movies or favorite foods) to explore basic questions:

1. **What’s the most popular item?**  
2. **What’s the trend over time?**  
3. **What would you recommend to a new person?**  

In the notebook (`notebook.ipynb`), you will:
- Load a dataset into a `pandas` DataFrame.  
- Do basic exploration (`head()`, `describe()`).  
- Create your **first plot** with `matplotlib`.
