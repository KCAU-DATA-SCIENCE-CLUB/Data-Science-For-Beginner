# 🧰 Lesson 3: Tools for Data Science

Welcome to **Tools for Data Science**!  
Every craftsperson needs the right tools—and so does a data scientist. In this lesson, we’ll open up the **Data Science Toolbox** and see what’s inside.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand the core tools every data scientist uses daily.
- Get comfortable with **Jupyter Notebooks**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.
- Learn how these tools fit together in a real workflow.

## 🪄 Story Hook

*Imagine  a painter without brushes.*  
They may have the skills, but without tools, they can’t bring their ideas to life.  

For data scientists, the **toolbox** includes:
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook** → a lab notebook where code, visuals, and notes live together.  
- 🐼 **pandas** → your Swiss army knife for handling tables and data.  
- 📊 **matplotlib** → your paintbrush for turning numbers into pictures.

## 🛠️ The Core Tools

### 1. Jupyter Notebook
Think of Jupyter as a **lab journal**:
- Write code in small steps (“cells”).
- Mix code, results, and notes together.
- Perfect for experiments and storytelling.  

👉 Example:  
```python
print("Hello, Data Science!")
