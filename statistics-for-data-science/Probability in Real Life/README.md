# ðŸ“˜ Lesson 2: Probability in Real Life

Probability helps us **measure uncertainty** and make **better decisions**. In data science, itâ€™s the foundation of predictions â€” from recommending movies to detecting fraud.

## ðŸŽ² What is Probability?

Probability is the **likelihood of an event occurring**, expressed as a number between `0` and `1`.

* `0` â†’ Impossible event
* `1` â†’ Certain event
* Example: Tossing a coin â†’ Probability of heads = `0.5`

---

## ðŸ§© Real-Life Analogy

Think of probability as **"how confident you are about something happening."**

* Coin toss â†’ 50% chance of heads
* Rolling a dice â†’ 1/6 chance of rolling a 4
* Customer buying a product â†’ 20% chance based on past data

---

## ðŸ“Š Formula for Probability

[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
]

Example: Rolling a dice and getting an even number
[
P(\text{Even}) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5
]

## ðŸŽ¥ Example in Data Science

* **Recommender Systems:** Netflix shows you a movie because thereâ€™s a **high probability** youâ€™ll like it based on your history.
* **Spam Filtering:** Emails are classified as spam if the probability is above a threshold (say 0.9).

## ðŸ’¡ Types of Probability

1. **Theoretical Probability** â†’ Coin toss = 50%
2. **Experimental Probability** â†’ Out of 100 tosses, 48 are heads â†’ Probability = 0.48
3. **Conditional Probability** â†’ Probability of event A given event B has occurred.

   * Example: Probability of a student passing **given** they studied for 10 hours.

## ðŸ“Š Visual Example

**Coin Toss Tree Diagram**

```
Start
 â”œâ”€â”€ Heads (0.5)
 â””â”€â”€ Tails (0.5)
```

**Two Tosses Example:**

```
Start
 â”œâ”€â”€ H (0.5)
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ H (0.25) â†’ HH
 â”‚    â””â”€â”€ T (0.25) â†’ HT
 â””â”€â”€ T (0.5)
      â”œâ”€â”€ H (0.25) â†’ TH
      â””â”€â”€ T (0.25) â†’ TT
```

* Probability of getting **2 Heads** = 0.25

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways

* Probability quantifies uncertainty.
* Real-life applications: recommender systems, spam detection, fraud detection.
* Conditional probability is crucial for understanding **dependencies**.
