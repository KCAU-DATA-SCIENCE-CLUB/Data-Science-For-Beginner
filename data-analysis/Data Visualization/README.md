# 🎨 Lesson 5: Data Visualization

After exploring your data with numbers and summaries, the next step is to **visualize it**. Data visualization is the art of turning raw numbers into **stories people can see and understand instantly**.

---

## 🧭 Why Visualization?

* Humans process images much faster than tables of numbers.
* Patterns and trends “pop out” visually.
* Helps communicate insights to non-technical audiences.

> Think of it like translating a book into a **picture book** — the story becomes easier to grasp.

## 📊 Common Visualization Types

1. **Bar Chart** → Compare categories
   Example: Sales by region.

   ```
   Region A: ███████
   Region B: ███████████
   Region C: ███
   ```

2. **Histogram** → Show distribution of values
   Example: Distribution of exam scores.

   ```
   0-20:   █
   20-40:  ████
   40-60:  ███████
   60-80:  ███████████
   80-100: █████
   ```

3. **Boxplot** → Spot outliers & spread
   Example: Income distribution (few very high earners).

4. **Scatterplot** → Show relationships between two variables
   Example: Study hours vs exam scores (positive trend).

5. **Line Chart** → Trends over time
   Example: Stock price over 1 year.

## 🛠️ Tools for Visualization

* **Matplotlib** → Core plotting library in Python.
* **Seaborn** → Built on Matplotlib, prettier and easier.
* **Pandas `.plot()`** → Quick plots directly from dataframes.

## 🎨 Example: Students’ Study Hours vs Scores

```
Scatterplot:
   Study Hours →  X-axis
   Exam Score  →  Y-axis

   (0,20)   ·
   (2,40)   ···
   (5,70)   ·····
   (8,90)   ·······
```

The plot shows: **more study hours generally = higher scores**, but not perfectly.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

* **Business:** Visualizing customer segments by age/income.
* **Healthcare:** Tracking patient vitals over time.
* **Sports:** Comparing player performance across seasons.

## ✅ Takeaway

Visualization makes your data **speak visually**.
It’s not just about making pretty charts — it’s about making **insights obvious**.
