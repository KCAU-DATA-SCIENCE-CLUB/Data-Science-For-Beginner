# 📊 Lesson 1: What is Data Analysis?

Data Analysis is the **process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data** to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making.

It sits at the **core of Data Science**, acting as the bridge between raw data and insights.

## 🔑 Difference Between Core Concepts

| Concept             | What it Means                                                                                                | Example                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Collection** | Gathering raw data from various sources (databases, APIs, surveys, sensors).                                 | Collecting Netflix viewing history, survey responses, or stock market data.  |
| **Data Cleaning**   | Preparing data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing inconsistencies.                  | Filling in missing customer ages, standardizing "USA"/"U.S." into one value. |
| **Data Analysis**   | Using statistical, visual, and logical methods to find patterns, correlations, and insights.                 | Analyzing whether more ads = higher sales.                                   |
| **Data Science**    | A broader field that includes collection, cleaning, analysis, plus machine learning and predictive modeling. | Building a recommender system that predicts what movies a user might watch.  |

👉 Think of it like **cooking**:

* Collection = buying groceries 🍅
* Cleaning = washing & cutting 🥕
* Analysis = tasting & adjusting flavors 👨‍🍳
* Data Science = creating a full recipe and meal 🍲

## 🧩 Types of Data Analysis

Data analysis isn’t just one thing — it can serve different purposes depending on the questions asked.

1. **Descriptive Analysis** – *“What happened?”*

   * Uses past data to summarize and describe.
   * Example: Average sales per month, number of new users last week.

2. **Diagnostic Analysis** – *“Why did it happen?”*

   * Digs deeper into causes of trends.
   * Example: Sales dropped because marketing budget was reduced.

3. **Predictive Analysis** – *“What will happen?”*

   * Uses statistics & machine learning to forecast future outcomes.
   * Example: Predicting student grades based on study hours.

4. **Prescriptive Analysis** – *“What should we do?”*

   * Suggests actions to optimize outcomes.
   * Example: Netflix recommending movies to retain users.

## 🌍 Real-World Examples

* **Sales Trends:** Analyzing seasonal peaks in shopping (e.g., Black Friday boosts).
* **Customer Churn:** Identifying why customers leave a subscription service.
* **Sports Analytics:** Using data to improve player performance strategies.
* **Healthcare:** Analyzing patient records to detect disease risks earlier.

## 📌 Visual Summary

**Types of Analysis Flowchart**

```
Data  →  Descriptive (What happened?)
      →  Diagnostic (Why did it happen?)
      →  Predictive (What will happen?)
      →  Prescriptive (What should we do?)
```

✅ In this lesson, you’ve learned **what data analysis is, its role in data science, the main types, and real-world applications**.

Next, we’ll move from “what is data analysis” → into the **hands-on process of cleaning and preparing data**.
