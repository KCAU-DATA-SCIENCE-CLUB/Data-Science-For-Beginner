# üìñ Data Science for a beginner

Welcome to **Data Science Storytelling**, a beginner-friendly and engaging repository created by the **Data Science Club**.

This course is not just about learning data science ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **experiencing it through stories**.
Every lesson begins with a **hands-on practice in Jupyter notebooks**, and ends with a **mini-project**.

Our goal: **make complex topics simple, clear, and fun** ‚Äî so beginners stay motivated and contributors know exactly how to teach.

## üåü Why this course is different

‚úÖ **Storytelling-first** ‚Üí We anchor every abstract idea in a concrete story (detectives, chefs, diaries, robots).
‚úÖ **Hands-on practice** ‚Üí Every lesson has a `notebook.ipynb` where you explore, code, and play.
‚úÖ **Projects-driven** ‚Üí Learners apply concepts in fun, real-world projects.
‚úÖ **Beginner-friendly** ‚Üí No prior background needed. We grow step by step.
‚úÖ **Contributor-ready** ‚Üí Consistent structure & templates for adding new lessons.

## üéØ Learning Journey

By the end of this course, learners will:

* Understand the **foundations of data science**.
* Work confidently with **data formats, cleaning, EDA, visualization**.
* Analyze data with **statistics & hypothesis testing**.
* Build and evaluate **basic ML models**.
* Communicate insights with **stories, visuals, and dashboards**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Start from Module 1** ‚Üí follow lessons in order.
2. Each lesson has:

   * `README.md` ‚Üí Story-driven explanation.
   * `notebook.ipynb` ‚Üí Hands-on practice.
   * `assets/` ‚Üí Supporting diagrams or visuals.
3. Do the **mini-projects** at the end of each module.
4. Try the **capstone project** to combine everything.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributors! To keep the course identity consistent:

* **Always begin with a story** in `README.md`.
* **Add hands-on code** in `notebook.ipynb`.
* **Use visuals** (put them in `assets/`).
* Follow the **lesson template** in `assets/templates/`.
* Open a PR with your lesson/module additions.

Do you want me to also add a **visual roadmap graphic (timeline style)** for the README so it feels even more like Tifo Football‚Äôs **storytelling aesthetic**?
